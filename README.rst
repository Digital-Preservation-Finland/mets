METS Library
============

This repository contains general Python functions for METS XML handling.

Requirements
------------

Installation and usage requires Python 3.9 or newer.
The software is tested with Python 3.9 on AlmaLinux 9 release.

Installation using RPM packages (preferred)
-------------------------------------------

Installation on Linux distributions is done by using the RPM Package Manager.
See how to `configure the PAS-jakelu RPM repositories`_ to setup necessary software sources.

.. _configure the PAS-jakelu RPM repositories: https://www.digitalpreservation.fi/user_guide/installation_of_tools 

After the repository has been added, the package can be installed by running the following command::

    sudo dnf install python3-mets

Usage
-----

Import the library with::

    import mets

All the functions can now be used with calling mets.<function>.

For example, the div() function in structmap_base.py can be used with::

    div_elem = mets.div(type_attr='xxx')

This creates a METS <div> element to div_elem as lxml.etree.

Please, see the METS documentation for more information:

Installation using Python Virtualenv for development purposes
-------------------------------------------------------------

Create a virtual environment::
    
    python3 -m venv venv

Run the following to activate the virtual environment::

    source venv/bin/activate

Install the required software with commands::

    pip install --upgrade pip==20.2.4 setuptools
    pip install -r requirements_github.txt
    pip install .

To deactivate the virtual environment, run ``deactivate``.
To reactivate it, run the ``source`` command above.
